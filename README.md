# Terntribe BUILD – Frontend Assessment (MERN Stack)

## Overview
This project is a responsive frontend UI for a social cause platform built with React and Tailwind CSS. It includes:
- A homepage with a Hero section, 4 cause cards, and a footer
- A "Get Involved" page with a form (Name, Email, and Cause dropdown)
- Fully responsive layout for mobile and desktop

## Tech Stack
- React (Vite)
- Tailwind CSS
- React Router DOM

## My Approach & Decisions
- I designed the UI with a mobile-first mindset, using Tailwind for clean and fast styling.
- Each cause card is dynamic and reusable, with content stored in a local array.
- The form is built for accessibility and future backend integration.
- Layout is responsive across screen sizes using Tailwind’s utility classes.
